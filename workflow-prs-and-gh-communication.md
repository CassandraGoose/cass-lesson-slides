Give students: https://thejunkland.com/blog/how-to-write-good-readme.html

how you write readmes will change depending on where you work, what language, etc. 

---

What do READMEs have to do with PRs and github communication? 

It's all about good communication. You'll avoid a lot of back and forth, issues, etc that you'll encounter in PRs and GitHub communication when you have a good README.

Issues

GH issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Most projects that you work on use some kind of project board (e.g. Waffle, Trello, Jira, etc.) to organize and share progress and information across the team. These trackers often connect directly to GitHub issues, but offer a more robust UI experience.

Notes:

React issues: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues
Vue issues: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues

demo Github Projects -> easy issue linking
trello -> https://blog.trello.com/github-and-trello-integrate-your-commits

Your Turn:

GH issues are often a great place to start when deciding what to work on, especially after you have setup a project board. Ideally, you should do this before you even start to code! Letâ€™s get some practice!

---

Todo:
<style type="text/css" rel="stylesheet">
  .list {
    font-size: 22pt;
  }
</style>

<span class="list">

- Open up your current project repo, click on the Issues tab, and then click the green New Issue button on the right.

- Think about a feature/bug that needs to be added. (Think of a specific small piece as opposed to a gigantic feature)

- Keep the title short and descriptive!

- Create a user story to determine what should happen. (Focus on the What, WHY, and WHO and less on the HOW)

- A good structure to follow with this is As a __, When I visit __, I want to __, so that I can __.

- Depending on the feature, you might even include Happy Path and Sad Path user stories!

- Think about any additional information that might be needed. This can included resources such as helpful links or relevant wireframes.
</span>

notes:
give examples of some user stories.

---

Breakout

- Let the other members read through your user story. The person sharing should NOT describe or fill in missing details.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- While reading through the issue, take notes of what parts are clear and what details are missing. (Reminder that the issue should not focus on the HOW)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Share notes and actionable feedback with each other. Be prepared to share takeways afterwards.

### Tags/Labels

Issue tagging with labels are an important part of keeping engineering and product teams aligned and organized across repositories. Multiple labels can be added to issues and allow for a developer to filter by one/many labels at once. This not only is helpful for the team but also for project managers to view what is being worked on and where a team is at.

---

Skim the link provided. What categories do they have? What colors do they use? Notice anything else?

Add some labels to the issue you were just working on.

Notes:

---

### Assignments and Linking

Assigning a person to an issue and linking an issue to a project board can again help in communication across the team on who is working on what at what time.

Notes: 
checkout the vue projects here and see how they are linked and assigned https://github.com/galio-org/galio/projects/4

---

Your turn:

- Assign yourself to your GH issue. (You should see your name next to the issue)
- Link the issue to your GH project. (You should now see the issue as a ticket on your project board!)
(These can be accessed on the right hand side of the issue near the Labels section.)

A note on the note in the online lesson. When you're on a team in the future, it's possible issues will be assigned differently.

---

### Code Reviews and Pull Requests

Code reviews can be an enlightening part of the collaboration process. It _can_ be one of the only times that collaborative learning happens on teams that do not pair.

It can help identify technical issues that lead to improvements and can also identify areas for improvement regarding communication!

---

A Pull Request (PR) is a method of submitting contributions to a project. 

Instead of pushing directly to a project, a PR acts as a medium for the members of a project to review the code and decide if it should be incorporated.

---

Post in the chat: 

What is a Pull Request?

What is the point of a Pull Request?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Are there are any rules that come to mind?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Notes:
benefits: shared fault, record of code and communication, filter to promote clean, bug-free (or as bug free as possible) code, place to ask questions and have discussions before time is wasted writing code that will not be used

also, there are analytic tools that use PR data to determine who's struggling on a team, who's succeeding, who needs to take a vacation ðŸ˜‚

Take a look at some examples of code reviews:

notes:
talk about what is good and what is bad

##### Pull Requests

It is important as the creator of the PR that you are giving other developers some context of what they are reviewing as well as what they should looking for in the change. In order to standardize what is discussed, pull request templates were created. Follow the steps in the link to create one for your project. Here are some recommended questions to get you started:

```
#### What's this PR do?
#### Where should the reviewer start?
#### How should this be manually tested?
#### Any background context you want to provide?
#### What are the relevant tickets?
#### Screenshots (if appropriate)
#### Questions:
```

Here is an example of my team's old PR template:

```
Title: Add degree comparison
What I did:
- Created dual modal system that shows two degrees side by side as shown in the designs.
- System allows for selecting different degrees while inside the modals
Link to specs/user story: ***link to Business Analyst's spec here***
Link to designs: ***link to specific page from inDesign***
All acceptance criteria completed? y/n YES
To test:
- Search for a degree and select one.
- On that degree modal, click a related degree. This should open a second modal next to the current one.
- Close the first modal and close the second modal. Did the correct one close?
- What happens when you open them in succession?
Notes/Questions:
- broke out dual modal system into several components for readability.
- this dual modal system is set up to work for careers as well (all data is dynamic)
- this is a complicated chunk of code. any thoughts on how to make it more understandable or future-proof?
All files linted? y/n YES
Unit tests passing: y/n YES
e2e tests passing: y/n YES
related PRs: none
```

GH Magic

- If you linked a PR to an issue, the issue will automagically close when the PR is merged ðŸŽ‰
